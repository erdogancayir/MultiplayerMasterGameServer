1. Game Server Architecture Overview

1.1. Server Components

    Socket Listener: Manages incoming TCP or UDP connections from the Master Server and players. It ensures smooth and continuous communication during gameplay.
    Game Session Manager: Handles the creation and management of game sessions. Each session represents an instance of the game being played by players in a lobby.
    Player Manager: Tracks the players in each game session, including their states, scores, and actions.
    Game Logic Processor: The core component that processes game rules, player actions, and updates game states accordingly.
    Real-time Communication Handler: Manages the real-time data exchange between players and the server, ensuring timely updates of game states.
    Database Interface: Interacts with the NoSQL database for storing and retrieving game-related data, such as player scores, game results, etc.
    Health Check and Recovery: Regularly checks the server's health and implements recovery mechanisms in case of failures.

1.2. Data Flow

    Game Session Initialization: Once players are assigned to the game server by the Master Server, a game session is initialized.
    Player Management: Tracks and manages player data and states throughout the game session.
    Gameplay Processing: Processes player actions, updates game states, and ensures game rules are followed.
    Real-time Updates: Continuously sends game state updates to players and receives player actions.
    Game Conclusion: At the end of the game, sends final scores and results to players and updates the database.

2. Communication Protocols

    Utilize TCP or UDP based on game requirements. UDP might be preferable for faster, real-time updates.
    Design an efficient messaging protocol using "Message Pack" for game state updates, player actions, and other communications.

3. Scalability and Performance

    Implement efficient data structures and algorithms for real-time game state processing to ensure low latency and high performance.
    Scale horizontally by adding more server instances as the number of players or game sessions increases.

4. Security and Fair Play

    Implement measures to prevent cheating and ensure fair play.
    Secure the communication channels to prevent eavesdropping or tampering with game data.

5. Monitoring and Diagnostics

    Implement logging for game events, player actions, and server performance metrics.
    Use monitoring tools to track server health, network latency, and resource utilization.

6. Game State Management and Persistence

    Manage game state effectively to ensure consistency and real-time responsiveness.
    Persist game results and player progress to the database at the end of each session.

7. Bonus Objective: Seamless Game Server Transition

    Implement mechanisms to save game states and transfer players to a different server seamlessly in case of a server failure.
    Synchronize game states across multiple servers for fault tolerance.

8. Development and Deployment

    Develop the Game Server as a .NET application, suitable for your chosen development platform.
    Use containerization for ease of deployment and management of server instances.
    Deploy on a cloud platform that supports the required infrastructure and database services.

This architecture is designed to ensure that your Game Server is capable of handling multiple simultaneous game sessions efficiently, with a focus on real-time communication, scalability, and providing a seamless gaming experience.
