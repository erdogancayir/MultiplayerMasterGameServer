1. Master Server Architecture Overview

1.1. Server Components

    Socket Listener: Handles incoming TCP or UDP socket connections from clients (players). It authenticates players and initiates their session.
    Authentication Service: Manages player authentication. It can use tokens or session IDs to maintain player sessions.
    Matchmaking Service: Responsible for creating lobbies, adding players to existing lobbies, or waiting for more players to start a new lobby.
    Lobby Manager: Manages multiple game lobbies, keeps track of players in each lobby, and communicates lobby status to players.
    Database Interface: Handles interactions with a NoSQL database (MongoDB/DynamoDB) for storing player data, game statistics, etc.
    Game Server Manager: Communicates with multiple game servers, checks their status, and allocates players to game servers.
    Heartbeat Monitor: Regularly sends pings to game servers to ensure they are running and accessible.

1.2. Data Flow

    Player Connection: Players connect to the Master Server via sockets.
    Authentication: Players are authenticated and their session is initiated.
    Matchmaking: Players are allocated to lobbies based on current lobby statuses.
    Lobby Status Update: Players receive updates about lobby status and game start countdown.
    Server Allocation: Once a game lobby is full, players are assigned to a game server.
    Game Server Status: The Master Server monitors game server statuses and handles server disconnections or failures.

2. Communication Protocols

    Use TCP or UDP based on your game's needs (TCP for reliability, UDP for speed).
    Implement a custom protocol for efficient data transfer using the "Message Pack" library. Structure your packets with a header containing information like packet format, data size, data type ID, followed by the actual data payload.

3. Scalability and Reliability

    Load Balancing: Implement load balancing to distribute player connections across multiple instances of the Master Server if needed.
    Fault Tolerance: Implement failover mechanisms for handling server crashes or disconnections. This includes rerouting players to other game servers if one fails.
    Database Replication: Use database replication for high availability and data redundancy.

4. Security Considerations

    Implement secure authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
    Encrypt sensitive data during transmission.
    Regularly update and patch server software to protect against vulnerabilities.

5. Monitoring and Logging

    Implement logging for tracking player activities, server performance, and error logs.
    Use monitoring tools to keep track of server health, resource usage, and performance metrics.

6. Development and Deployment

    Develop the Master Server as a .NET application.
    Containerize the server application for easy deployment and scaling.
    Deploy on a cloud platform with support for Linux/Windows environments and NoSQL databases.

7. Bonus Objective: Multi-Server Continuity

    Implement a system where game state is regularly saved or replicated across multiple game servers.
    In case of a game server failure, seamlessly transfer players to an available server without losing game progress.

This architecture aims to provide a robust, scalable, and efficient Master Server for your multiplayer game, ensuring smooth player experiences during login, matchmaking, and transitioning to game servers.

Server Components and Their Corresponding Classes

    Socket Listener (SocketListener Directory)
        SocketListener.cs: Manages incoming socket connections (TCP/UDP) from players. It initializes player sessions and hands off authentication to the AuthService.
        ConnectionHandler.cs: Handles individual socket connections, managing the data flow between the server and connected clients.

    Authentication Service (Authentication Directory)
        AuthService.cs: Manages player authentication, verifies credentials or tokens.
        TokenManager.cs: Handles token generation and validation for maintaining player sessions.

    Matchmaking Service (Matchmaking Directory)
        Matchmaker.cs: Responsible for creating and managing game lobbies, matchmaking logic.
        LobbyManager.cs: Manages the state and participants of game lobbies.

    Database Interface (Database Directory)
        DbInterface.cs: Central point for interacting with the MongoDB/DynamoDB database.
        PlayerManager.cs: Manages player-related data in the database.
        LobbyManager.cs: (Duplicate) Manages lobby data in the database. This might be an architectural oversight, as LobbyManager.cs is also listed under Matchmaking.

    Game Server Management (GameServerManagement Directory)
        GameServerManager.cs: Communicates with game server instances, managing their state and load balancing.
        HeartbeatMonitor.cs: Regularly checks the status of game servers to ensure their availability.

    Models (Models Directory)
        Player.cs, Lobby.cs: Define the data structures for player and lobby data, respectively. These models are used by the database interface to interact with the database collections.
