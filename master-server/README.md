1. Master Server Architecture Overview

1.1. Server Components

    Socket Listener: Handles incoming TCP or UDP socket connections from clients (players). It authenticates players and initiates their session.
    Authentication Service: Manages player authentication. It can use tokens or session IDs to maintain player sessions.
    Matchmaking Service: Responsible for creating lobbies, adding players to existing lobbies, or waiting for more players to start a new lobby.
    Lobby Manager: Manages multiple game lobbies, keeps track of players in each lobby, and communicates lobby status to players.
    Database Interface: Handles interactions with a NoSQL database (MongoDB/DynamoDB) for storing player data, game statistics, etc.
    Heartbeat Monitor: Regularly sends pings to game servers to ensure they are running and accessible.

1.2. Data Flow

    Player Connection: Players connect to the Master Server via sockets.
    Authentication: Players are authenticated and their session is initiated.
    Matchmaking: Players are allocated to lobbies based on current lobby statuses.
    Lobby Status Update: Players receive updates about lobby status and game start countdown.
    Game Server Status: The Master Server monitors game server statuses and handles server disconnections or failures.

Communication Protocols

    Use TCP or UDP based on your game's needs (TCP for reliability, UDP for speed).
    Implement a custom protocol for efficient data transfer using the "Message Pack" library. Structure your packets with a header containing information like packet format, data size, data type ID, followed by the actual data payload.

Logging

    Implement logging for tracking player activities, server performance, and error logs.

Development and Deployment

    Develop the Master Server as a .NET application.
    Containerize the server application for easy deployment and scaling.
    Deploy on a cloud platform with support for Linux/Windows environments and NoSQL databases.

This architecture aims to provide a robust, scalable, and efficient Master Server for your multiplayer game, ensuring smooth player experiences during login, matchmaking, and transitioning to game servers.

Matchmaker Workflow

    Player Queueing:
        Players can request to join a matchmaking queue by sending a JoinLobbyRequest.
        The Matchmaker adds these players to the matchmakingQueue.

    Matchmaking Process:
        Periodically, or whenever a new player is added, Matchmaker checks if there are enough players in the queue to form a match (requiredPlayersForMatch).
        This check is done in TryCreateMatch.

    Lobby Creation:
        Once enough players are in the queue, Matchmaker dequeues the required number of players and creates a new Lobby with these players.
        The Lobby status is initially set to "Waiting".

    Notifying Players:
        After creating a new Lobby, Matchmaker should notify the dequeued players that they have been placed in a lobby.
        This can be done by sending a MatchmakingResponse to each player with the details of the lobby they've been assigned to.

    Lobby Management:
        Players can send a LeaveLobbyRequest if they decide to leave the lobby before a game starts.
        The LobbyManager can update lobby statuses, such as when a game is starting (StartGameCountdown), or if a lobby's status changes (UpdateLobbyStatus).

Server Components and Their Corresponding Classes

    Socket Listener (SocketListener Directory)
        SocketListener.cs: Manages incoming socket connections (TCP/UDP) from players. It initializes player sessions and hands off authentication to the AuthService.
        ConnectionHandler.cs: Handles individual socket connections, managing the data flow between the server and connected clients.

    Authentication Service (Authentication Directory)
        AuthService.cs: Manages player authentication, verifies credentials or tokens.
        TokenManager.cs: Handles token generation and validation for maintaining player sessions.

    Matchmaking Service (Matchmaking Directory)
        Matchmaker.cs: Responsible for creating and managing game lobbies, matchmaking logic.

    Database Interface (Database Directory)
        DbInterface.cs: Central point for interacting with the MongoDB/DynamoDB database.
        PlayerManager.cs: Manages player-related data in the database.
        LobbyManager.cs: (Duplicate) Manages lobby data in the database. This might be an architectural oversight, as LobbyManager.cs is also listed under Matchmaking.

    Models (Models Directory)
        Player.cs, Lobby.cs: Define the data structures for player and lobby data, respectively. These models are used by the database interface to interact with the database collections.
